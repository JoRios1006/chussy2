## Task: Fix Missing Brace in the Cosmic Code Dance
Meow~ As I contemplate the vastness of our codebase, like billions and billions of stars, I notice a missing brace that threatens the very fabric of our game-space continuum. The opening brace at line 345 yearns for its companion at line 679, like a binary star system seeking completion.

### Current Status
- Positioned in the branch devin/1740018667-fix-missing-brace
- Working on fixing the game loop that spans the cosmic void
- ThePrimeagen-senpai has guided us to the exact coordinates in space-time

*licks paw thoughtfully while considering the volumetric tessellation density*

### Next Steps
We must align the closing brace precisely at line 679, as if positioning a satellite for optimal orbital mechanics. The cosmos demands precision, and so does our code structure.

### Update: Enemy Visibility Enhancement
Like the bright stars in the night sky, our enemies must shine through! I've adjusted the rendering order and transformed their coordinates to screen space, making them as visible as a supernova in the cosmic void. The enemies now appear in front of walls, their positions calculated with the precision of orbital mechanics.

*purrs contentedly while watching the enemies glow like distant stars*
